# vim-flack

Barebones file explorer. Looks for git repo for project root.

`:Flack` will open the explorer in project root if found, or current folder.
Use `enter` and `backspace` to navigate.

Open specific folder by using `:e <folder>`. For example `:e %:h` to open an explorer in the directory of the current file.
